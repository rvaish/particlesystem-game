Human vision is a complex process that is not yet completely understood, humans perceive colors through rod and cone cells. Apart from understanding biological aspects of human vision, psychological perception capabilities also play an important role; this area of study is called psychophysics. This paper explores the same through pre-attentive processing which is a subconscious collection of visual information from the surroundings. To test the dynamic color changes and the pre-attentive processing nature of individuals, a game has been designed and developed using processing framework which asks users to shoot the target object (newly colored) among the bunch of grouped objects (old colored) in the background close to that of the grouped oneâ€™s. The data is gathered through MobileWorks, a human computation/crowdsourcing platform. The task of color recognition is further complimented by varying attributes such as size, transparency, shape, number and speed of particles. It is observed that the color recognition not only depends on the difference in hue value between particles and background, but also on the above mentioned attributes.
